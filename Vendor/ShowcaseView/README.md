Showcase View library  
====
  
The ShowcaseView library is designed to highlight and showcase specific parts of apps to the user with a distinctive and attractive overlay. This library is great for pointing out points of interest for users, gestures, or obscure but useful items.

The library is based on the "Cling" view found in the Launcher on Ice-Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean, but extended to be easier to use.

Please check out [the website](http://espiandev.github.com/ShowcaseView) for more information.

Set-up
----

For people who use Maven, ShowcaseView should work immediately without any issues. If you aren't, you'll need to download the [NineOldAndroids library](https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids) and add it as a dependency library to the ShowcaseView library. Then add ShowcaseView as a library dependency to your project, and you're done! 

**WARNING:** Sometimes Eclipse/IDEA will automatically import the non-NineOldAndroid versions of the animation classes, which will cause crashes on versions of Android below 3.0. Check that your imports start with `com.nineoldandroids.animation` and not `android.animation`.

Usage
----

v2 brings the ability to showcase items on the ActionBar. Currently built in showcase-able things are:
- The home button 
- Your application title or a Spinner if you're using that navigation type
- Any ActionItem - requires only the item's ID
- The Overflow icon   

Gestures can now be indicated using `animateGesture(...)`, which returns a [NineOldAndroids](http://nineoldandroids.com) `AnimatorSet`, which can be gestured simply by calling `start()` on it. If you want to make your own gestures, `getHand()` will return the View which contains the Ghostly Hand. You can also quickly point to something using the `pointTo(..)` methods.

Styles are included to maintain consistently in ShowcaseViews. Buttons should use the style ClingButton, with title text using ClingTitleText and standard text using ClingText.

Upcoming features
----

- Improved styling ability
- Variable sized circles/images for showcasing
